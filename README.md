# SchneiderCSV2Pluto
Schneider Electric PowerLogic EGX300 devices generate badly formated (fake) CSVs and those are usually uploaded to Dexma.
In order to feed them to Pluto reports I do a Man In the Middle and get them to a FTP folder, change them to a standard CSV format and then upload them to Dexma.
